# California Housing Price Prediction - MLOps Project

This project implements a complete MLOps workflow for the California Housing dataset, enabling automated, reproducible, and production-ready model deployment. The pipeline spans from dataset preparation to monitoring in production, ensuring that the deployed model consistently delivers high-quality predictions.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The architecture is built on a containerized MLOps pipeline for training, serving, monitoring, and visualizing the model. It leverages Docker for orchestration, ensuring portability, scalability, and reproducibility.

## üöÄ Project Summary

This project delivers an industry-standard MLOps pipeline that automates the entire machine learning lifecycle. The approach ensures reproducibility, scalability, and maintainability while selecting and deploying the best regression model based on R¬≤ score, making it ready for real-world production use.

### 1. Data Versioning and Preprocessing

The California Housing dataset was loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare target variables. A clean, modular directory structure was maintained for data, source code, and models, with dataset versioning managed using DVC to ensure reproducibility.

### 2. Model Development and Experiment Tracking

Two regression models, Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor, were trained. All experiments were tracked using **MLflow**, recording parameters, metrics, and artifacts. The best model, evaluated on the highest R¬≤ score, was registered in the MLflow Model Registry for deployment.

### 3. API Development and Containerization

A **FastAPI**-based prediction API was developed to accept JSON input and return predicted house values. The entire service was packaged into a **Docker** container for consistent deployment across any environment.

### 4. CI/CD Automation with GitHub Actions

A **GitHub Actions** workflow was implemented to automate linting, testing, building Docker images, and pushing them to Docker Hub. This ensures zero manual intervention from code commit to service deployment.

### 5. Logging and Monitoring

Structured logging was implemented for all incoming prediction requests and their outputs, stored for auditing. An optional `/metrics` endpoint was added to expose runtime performance statistics, supporting integration with monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| **Category** | **Technology** | 
| :--- | :--- |
| **Orchestration** | Docker, Docker Compose | 
| **Experiment Tracking** | MLflow | 
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus, Grafana | 
| **API Framework** | FastAPI | 
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | 
| **Data Version Control** | DVC (optional) | 
| **Machine Learning** | Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy | 
| **Web Development** | HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript | 

## ‚öôÔ∏è End-to-End Workflow

1. **Model Training:** A training script logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow, which stores the data in a persistent volume.

2. **Model Deployment:** FastAPI loads the latest registered model from MLflow for inference and exposes prediction APIs.

3. **Monitoring & Visualization:** Prometheus scrapes metrics from FastAPI, and Grafana displays this data in real-time dashboards for insights into model performance and system health.
